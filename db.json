      "description": "The Consider the Raven Reverb by Mercy Seat Effects comes in a variety of finishes and is based on the 'Box of Hall' circuitry by Culturejam. Its simple circuit and knobs mirror the intuitiveness of this reverb, which falls somewhere between a spring and hall reverb. All that needs adjusting are the Volume and Damp knobs, which effect only the reverb effect and not your guitar's tone."
